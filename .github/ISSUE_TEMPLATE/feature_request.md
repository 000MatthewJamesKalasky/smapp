### Rationale

What do we have now, what do we want then?
How the implementation would make the product better for end-users?

### Prerequisites

Refer to issues by their #numbers that should be completed before the development of this issue would make sense

### User story

Describe the most straightforward usage scenario

1. I open this
2. I create that
3. I click there
4. I benefit from the result in a such way

### Acceptance criteria

Provide some steps that an end-user would be able to perform when the feature could be considered as implemented. E.g.:

- [ ] The basic scenario works as described
- [ ] If I do not enter a value, an error is shown
- [ ] Clicking OK changes all nodes’ labels to the Foo value

### Out of scope

Explicitly list functionality that is not intended to be done with this story.

### How to implement

If you have an idea of how to implement it, provide a short description.

### How to test

How can we test what’s implemented?
